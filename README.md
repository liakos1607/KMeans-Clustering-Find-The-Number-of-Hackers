# KMeans-Clustering-Find-The-Number-of-Hackers
A large technology say they've been hacked! Luckily their forensic engineers have grabbed valuable data about the hacks, including information like session time,locations, wpm typing speed, etc. The forensic engineer relates to you what she has been able to figure out so far, she has been able to grab meta data of each session that the hackers used to connect to their servers. The technology firm has 3 potential hackers that perpetrated the attack. Their certain of the first two hackers but they aren't very sure if the third hacker was involved or not.Using the tool of Pyspark   with help of KMeans we are building two Clusters one with k=2 and one with k=3 .After the deployment it is proved that in k=2 the group of hackers(predictions) are even so the number of hackers are two.
